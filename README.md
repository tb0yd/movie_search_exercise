Coding Exercise

[Demo](http://moviesearchexercise.herokuapp.com/?#)

Points:

* Single page application
* Vanilla JS
* `dash-case` followed for CSS ids and classes, `camelCase` followed for JS functions
* Browser history & back/forward functionality is maintained
* App has mobile-first design & should be viewed from a small viewport
* All HTML, CSS, JS validated

Things to look into:

* It may be worth extracting out the XHR handling into one utility function.
* Server-side rendering
* Split up Javascript and recombine into bundles with Webpack
